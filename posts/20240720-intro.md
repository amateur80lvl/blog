# My first blog entry

Of course it's not the very first entry and not the first my blog.
Previously I had a few but I dropped them all.
Maybe I'll drop this one someday so hurry up and fork it.

There some posts and articles I can't delete but I have no least desire to refer to them.
It's funny, I commenced the last bunch of them exactly one year ago.

I believe github is the ideal place for hate speech and shitty code.
That's why I'm here.
Goodbye blogging sites.
Goodbye self-hosted crap.
Hello, github!
I am here to feed your AI training pipeline with shit.
Your place is next to sourceforge!
Hello users!
Write shit!
Fork shit!
Revoke your stars from projects you use and truly love!
Give them to me and other shitty projects!
That's the way!
We'll win this war!

Okay, the intro is complete. Bye-bye for now.
